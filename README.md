# SAML Proper
In order to better understand WebLogic's handling of federated identity,
I decide to follow the tutorial here: https://blogs.oracle.com/blogbypuneeth/steps-to-configure-saml-sso-with-azure-as-idp-and-weblogic-server-as-sp

Since I'm fully Azure may as well try out Bicep - https://github.com/Azure/bicep/blob/main/docs/tutorial/01-simple-template.md

I'll install bicep directly with the latest version of az that I built myself (because I don't like homebrew):

	az bicep install
